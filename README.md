A project to track CSHers' moods throughout the day/week/year


Sometime around March, Klaus found one of those thumbs up/down LED signs that we used to use for major projects or 10wks or something. He wired it up to a 12V DC supply in the most sketch way possible. I thought it was dumb, but it was also kinda pretty, sitting in the user center...

Then I found the other one, and I had a great idea: What if we hooked these up to some kinda website where people report their mood? It'd be funny to see how quick we could get one to go all red.

I was trying to build it using an ESP01 I found in the Research Room, but that quickly fell apart due to how _scuffed_ the platform was. Gonna need to re-write it for the ESP32 so I can have a little more breathing room for things like... MQTT.

I need to make a wiring diagram. Hopefully I took a photo.
